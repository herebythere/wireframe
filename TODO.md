If im a developer I need access to components quickly

If the component can be included through css,
I can include the style, no js included.

button
checkbox
radio
switch
breadcrumb
dialog
menu


If the component requires Shadow DOM
There needs to be a way to apply a template
But that involves a framework, There needs to be
templates involved

```hmtl
<template declarativeshadowdom>
<custom-element>
	<slot></slot>
<custom-element>
{}
<template>
```
